# TODO
```
(‚≠ê) - Support the user token
(üó®Ô∏è) - DM to all user in discord server
(‚ö†Ô∏è) - Panic mode (Like make the server owner panic)
```

# Features
```
- Create a Mass channel and spam it
- Delete all Channel/Roles
- Ban everyone
```

# Updates
- We've made a change from controlling the bot on the target server to placing it on the target server, allowing you to use commands from any server. This adjustment aims to make the raiding process less detectable.

# Install
